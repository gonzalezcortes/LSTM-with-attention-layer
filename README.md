# LSTM with Explainability using an attention layer

In this notebook introduces a prediction using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with explainability. The data set used is "Power consumption of Tetouan city Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Also a prediction using XGBoost with different explanatory framework named SHAP was used to compare the LSTM with explainability.
